# Visualisation-and-Validation-Report
The purpose of this assingment was to identify a suitable range of visualisations for a problem and then select an appropriate subset and then create validation and updates plans to accompany them.

This assessment demonstratedd my understadning of:
1) Recommend methodologies and mathematical tools for the use of data science in a
modern organisation

2) Use data science to evaluate and describe best practice in modern organisations
and societies

3) Analyse issues associated with the use of data for solving complex problems

4) Evaluate the tools used in the data science community for reporting on data
analysis.
